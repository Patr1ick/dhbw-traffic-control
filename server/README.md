# Server

## Production

To use the server for production the [docker-compose.yaml](https://github.com/Patr1ick/dhbw-traffic-control/blob/main/server/docker-compose.yaml) can be used.

### Prerequisites

Note that the IP addresses for YugabyteDB need to be changed for the database to work! You have to change the following things **for each node individually**:

### Start the docker container

After that, the docker compose can be started with the following command.

```bash
# Build if needed
sudo docker compose build
# Start container
sudo docker compose up -d
```

The following ports are used and need to be available:
| Port | Description |
|--------|---------------------------------------|
| `7000` | Webserver of YugabyteDB master |
| `7100` | Internode RPC communication (master) |
| `8080` | REST-API of the backend |
| `9000` | Webserver of the YugabyteDB tserver |
| `9100` | Internode RPC communication (tserver) |
| `9042` | Client API for CQL |

The YugabyteDB masters will select a leader according to the Raft concensus. At least two masters need to be available for this proccess. When a leader is elected the server will be able to connect to the database. The server will initialised the keyspace and table if they are not existing. After that the server can used under the port as defined earlier.

#### Clean-Up Database

You need install ycqlsh according to the installation tutorial [here](https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/admin/ycqlsh/).

```bash
# Access database
ycqlsh -u cassandra -p cassandra <ip>:<port>
# Remove all rows
TRUNCATE traffic_control.clients;
```

## Local Development Setup

### Requirements

A running instance of YugabyteDB has to be accessible under the port `9042` (default ycql port). You can use the [docker-compose-dev.yaml](https://github.com/Patr1ick/dhbw-traffic-control/blob/main/docker-compose-dev.yaml) to setup the YugabyteDB (and/or the server).

### Build and run

```bash
# Build
go build main.go
# Start the server (for windows: .\main.exe ...)
main.exe <arguments>
```

| Argument          | Description                                                     | required |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `-x`, `--width`   | Width of the field                                              | `true`   |
| `-y`, `--height`  | Height of the field                                             | `true`   |
| `-z`, `--depth`   | Depth of the field (how many clients per positions are allowed) | `true`   |
| `-a`, `--address` | The address of the Yugabyte Database                            | `true`   |

The server will start and listen to port **8080**.

### Docker

Alternatively, the docker image can be build and started as followed. Note that the settings in the docker container is in Release mode which means the webserver is not debugging.

```bash
# Build docker container
docker build -t traffic_control .
# Start the server (insert your address)
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e DATABASE_ADDRESS=<your-database-here> traffic_control
```
